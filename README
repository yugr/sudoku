= Overview =

This is a simple Sudoku solver that I've started to experiment with SAT/SMT solvers.

= Plan =

* run for inputs up to 100x100 (k=10)
* plot timing graphs (time vs. #constraints, #constraints vs. #vars)
* experiment with SMT solvers

= TODO =

* find all solutions
* put temp files in separate folder
* FIXME
* Haddocks
* better deps tracking (?)

= Read =

* using GHC
* what's the proper way to do error handling? what about nested ifs and cases ?
* same for assertions? how about (ab)using guards?
